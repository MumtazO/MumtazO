I am a School of Code bootcamp graduate with experience of a range of full stack applications looking for my first role as a Junior Software Developer. Through the bootcamp I struggled initially with the technical jargon however I am now able breakdown code in ways that is easily digestible to even those who donâ€™t come from a coding background. I was able to work with people from various backgrounds and enjoyed the collaborative learning experience that the bootcamp provided. Not only did I gain new technical skills and a stronger understanding on web design but I have also gained a new sense of self confidence and the tools I need to further improve and hone my coding skills. 

Skills: JavaScript (ES6) Â· HTML Â· CSS Â· React Â· NextJS Â· NodeJS Â· Express Â· PostgreSQL Â· Heroku Â· Netlify Â· Git Â· Jest Â· Cypress.
